# PhysicsWebsite

This is a Web Portal for physics students.
It has lesson content of chapter light shadows and reflections referred from NCERT text book class 6 and there is a Quiz related to it.
I have used React to create the UserInterface.
Used tailwind-css and framer-motion for the styling and animation.
Used firebase for the google authenticated Logn .
